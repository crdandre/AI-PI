# AI-PI
Can't pin your PI down to review a manuscript?
No problem! The AI-PI will take care of it!

Jokes aside this is a tool to streamline the review process. Using prior materials from your PI's review process, you can more likely take care of the things they'd always find and comment on, freeing up cognitive load to focus on the less-obvious review points.
