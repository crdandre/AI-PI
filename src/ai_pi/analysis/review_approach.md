# Paper Review Approach

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach used for reviewing academic papers, implementing a context-aware, hierarchical review process that maintains global understanding while providing detailed section-specific feedback.

## Review Process

### 1. Build Paper Knowledge
First, the system builds a comprehensive understanding of the paper:
- Extracts research problem and hypotheses
- Maps key methods and findings
- Analyzes section dependencies
- Computes initial metrics

### 2. Section-Specific Reviews
Each section is reviewed according to specific criteria:

#### Abstract
- **Focus**: Balance, completeness, alignment with paper
- **Avoid**: Technical details, extensive background
- **Key Questions**: Are key findings represented? Is scope appropriate?

#### Introduction
- **Focus**: Problem framing, literature coverage, hypothesis/objective clarity
- **Avoid**: Detailed methodological critiques, results interpretation
- **Key Questions**: Is the research gap clear? Are objectives well-justified?

#### Methods
- **Focus**: Reproducibility, technical soundness, procedure completeness
- **Avoid**: Discussing implications or broader impact
- **Key Questions**: Could another researcher replicate this? Are choices justified?

#### Results
- **Focus**: Data presentation, statistical reporting, factual outcomes
- **Avoid**: Detailed interpretation, speculation about mechanisms
- **Key Questions**: Are findings clearly presented? Is statistical reporting complete?

#### Discussion
- **Focus**: Result interpretation, context in literature, limitations
- **Avoid**: Introducing new results, detailed methods
- **Key Questions**: Are conclusions supported by results? Are limitations addressed?

### 3. Quality Metrics
Each section and the overall paper are evaluated using standardized metrics:
- Clarity
- Methodology
- Novelty
- Impact
- Presentation
- Literature Integration

### 4. Review Components

#### Section Analysis

@dataclass
class SectionAnalysis:
section_type: str
content_summary: str
role_in_paper: str
key_points: List[str]
dependencies: List[str]
supports: List[str]
metrics: ScoringMetrics

#### Review Items
Each review item includes:
- Match text (specific text being commented on)
- Comment (feedback or suggestion)
- Revision (proposed revised text, if applicable)

## Output Structure

## Quality Control

### Review Quality Validation
Each review undergoes quality validation checking for:
1. **Depth**: Theoretical analysis and methodological critique
2. **Integration**: Connections across sections and to broader literature
3. **Specificity**: Concrete examples and actionable suggestions

### Improvement Process
If quality criteria aren't met:
1. System identifies specific areas needing improvement
2. Generates additional review iteration with enhanced focus
3. Validates updated review against quality criteria

## Key Features

### Context Awareness
- Maintains global paper understanding
- Tracks section dependencies
- Ensures cross-section consistency

### Scientific Focus
- Emphasizes substantive scientific concerns
- Avoids superficial editing
- Maintains section-appropriate feedback

### Actionable Feedback
- Provides specific suggestions
- Includes concrete revisions where appropriate
- Maintains focus on improving scientific quality

### Quality Assurance
- Validates review quality
- Ensures comprehensive coverage
- Maintains scientific depth
